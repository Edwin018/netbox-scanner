# netbox-scanner
A scanner util for [NetBox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), because certain networks can be updated automagically.  `netbox-scanner` aims to create, update, and delete hosts (`/32`) in NetBox, either discovered after network probes and imported from CSV files.


## Installation
`netbox-scanner` is compatible with Python 3.6+, and can be installed like this:

    $ wget https://github.com/forkd/netbox-scanner/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip netbox-scanner-master.zip -d netbox-scanner
    $ cd netbox-scanner
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python netbox-scanner/nbscanner

Note that `netbox-scanner` will require [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and an instance of NetBox (tested under NetBox 2.4.4) ready to use.


## Scanning the Network
To use `netbox-scanner` as a script, simply run `netbox-scanner/nbscanner` and it'll create its configuration file (`.netbox-scanner.conf`) in your home folder:

    $ python nbscanner

After that, you'll just need to edit that file with your environment settings and run the script again, and `netbox-scanner` will do the following tasks:

1. It will scan all networks defined in the configuration file.
2. For each discovered host it will:
    1. If it is in NetBox, description is different, and `tag` is equal to that defined in the configuration file, description will be updated in NetBox.
    2. If host is not in NetBox, it'll be created.
3. The script will iterate through each network to find and delete any hosts registered in NetBox that did not respond to scan, and have the `tag` defined in the configuration file.

For instance, if some hosts in your monitored networks are eventually down, but you don't want `netbox-scanner` to manage them, just make sure that they **don't** have the tag defined in the configuration file.

Of course, you can use `cron` to automatically run `nbscanner`.


## Configuration File
`netbox-scanner` have a configuration file with all parameters needed to scan networks and synchronize them to NetBox.  By default, this file is located at user's home folder and is created when `nbscanner` is executed for the first time.  Before using `nbscanner` you should edit that file and fill all variables according to your environment.


## Importing from CSV File
`netbox-scanner` can import data from CSV files in the following format:

    IP Address,Description
    10.0.0.1,Gateway
    10.0.0.2,NTP Server
    ...

Note that the first line is header, IP addresses aren't in CIDR notation (a `/32` will be appended to all addresses automatically) and commas aren't accepted in description.  You can import this file using the `--csv` parameter, like this:

    $ nbscanner --csv netbox.csv
